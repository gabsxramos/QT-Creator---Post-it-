# Qt Post-it Application 📌

A lightweight, cross-platform desktop "Post-it" note application developed using the **C++ Qt Framework**. This project allows users to create, edit, and manage digital sticky notes directly on their desktop, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.

## 📝 About the Project
This application serves as a practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** design. It leverages Qt's signaling and slots mechanism to handle user interactions and window management.

### Key Features:
* **Dynamic Note Creation:** Create multiple sticky notes on the fly.
* **Custom UI:** A personalized interface designed using Qt Widgets.
* **State Management:** Handles window lifecycle and text input efficiently.

## 🛠 Repository Structure

* `Postit.pro`: The main Qt Project file containing configurations, included libraries, and source file lists.
* `main.cpp`: The entry point of the application. It initializes the `QApplication` and displays the main window.
* `mainwindow.cpp / .h`: The core logic and header for the main application interface.
* `mainwindow.ui`: The XML-based layout file generated by Qt Designer.
* `.gitignore`: Specifically configured to exclude build artifacts (debug/release/build-*) and local Qt Creator settings (`.pro.user`).

## 💻 Development Environment Setup

While this project was built using **Qt Creator**, you can develop and edit it in **VS Code** for a more modern coding experience.


## ⚠️ Initial Configuration (Required)

Before running the application, you need to configure the file storage path for the "Save" and "Open" features:

1.  Open the file `janela.h` (or `mainwindow.h`).
2.  Locate the variable named `file`.
3.  Update its value to match a valid path on your computer.
    * *Example:* `QString file = "C:/Users/YourName/Documents/file.txt";`

If this path is not updated, the application will not be able to find or create the text database, resulting in errors when trying to manage your notes.


### 1. Essential VS Code Extensions
To get the best experience, install the following:
* **C/C++ (Microsoft):** Provides IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing.
* **Qt Tools (Aleksandr):** Helps with `.ui` file integration and Qt-specific syntax.
* **CMake / Tools:** (Optional) if you plan to migrate the build system from `qmake`.

### 2. Configuring IntelliSense
If you see "red squiggly lines" on your `#include <QApplication>` statements, VS Code needs to know where your Qt libraries are:
1.  Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and select **C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)**.
2.  Locate the **Include path** section.
3.  Add the path to your Qt installation. It usually looks like this:
    * `C:/Qt/6.x.x/mingw_64/include/**`
4.  Set the **Compiler path** to your `g++` or `clang` executable inside the Qt/Tools folder.

## 🚀 How to Build and Run

### The Recommended Way: Qt Creator
Since this project uses the `qmake` build system (`.pro` file), the most stable way to run it is through **Qt Creator**:
1.  Open **Qt Creator**.
2.  Go to `File -> Open File or Project` and select `Postit.pro`.
3.  Select your Desktop Kit (e.g., Desktop Qt 6.x.x MinGW 64-bit).
4.  Click the **Green Play Button** (or press `Ctrl + R`) to build and run.

### Running via Terminal (CLI)
If you have the Qt bin folder added to your system environment variables:
```bash
# 1. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 2. Run qmake on the project file
qmake ../Postit.pro

# 3. Compile (use 'make' on Linux or 'mingw32-make' on Windows)
mingw32-make

# 4. Run the executable
./Postit.exe
```
